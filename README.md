# Purpose

This repository contains the Macmillan Accessible EPUB Specification as an EPUB file (and an unzipped version of the EPUB file), which describes the rules and guidelines for creating an EPUB file for Macmillan Learning. 

# Definitions

- Editor: The party responsible for the actual updates to the text of the Specification in this repository. 
- Reviewer: The party is accountable for the updates to the Specification. 
- Stakeholder: Anyone (or anyone who represents a party) who may be impacted by a change to the Specification and should be consulted and/or informed. 

# How to update this specification

1. A stakeholder opens a [Jira ticket on the Jira board](https://macmillanlearning.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/EPUB/boards/393).
2. The Reviewer and relevant stakeholders refine the Jira ticket.
3. Once the final language of the rule change is made, the Editor makes any requested changes based on the Jira ticket to a separate github branch.
4. The Editor makes a pull request to the Reviewer.
5. The Reviewer verifies that every change made in the new branch matches the set of requests in the Jira ticket.
6. Once the Reviewer approves the changes, they may also approve the pull request.
7. The new version of the Specification is distributed to all Stakeholders. 

# Additional Considerations

When making a rule, consider whether a complementary Validator rule or authoring tool modification may be introduced to enforce this rule. 

The language of the Specification from a purely editorial perspective could also be modified. It may be decided to modify it without the need for a separate Jira ticket to be opened.
